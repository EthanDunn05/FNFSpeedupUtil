3. Run the .exe file in the extracted folder!

## Known Issues

- There is no built in way to change the speed of animations. This can cause gameplay to be obstructed
  from an animation that hides gameplay lasting too long.

## FAQ

### A mod doesn't work!
Report the mod on the [issues page](https://github.com/EthanDunn05/FNFSpeedupUtil/issues). Either there is a problem on your end or the mod is not
supported. In the case that the mod is not supported, you will be kept updated for when and if support will be added.

### Animations are still normal speed!
This is intentional as knowing which animations are related to a song is practically impossible and very mod dependant.
If you want / need to change their speed, you will need to do so manually.
If what you're looking for is a video file, then use ffmpeg or some other program to speed it up. 

If it's a flash animation then I can't help you.

## For Developers:

### Building
Build this just like any other C# program. I'll update with more detailed instructions eventually.

### Contributing
You are welcome to submit pull requests, but make sure you at least follow these guidelines:
- Follow standard C# practices and naming conventions. 
- **Don't name things like the FNF source code does.** AKA use clear and understandable names for things.
- Make tests using XUnit for core functionality. The TUI does not need to be as thoroughly tested.
- Be respectful.
